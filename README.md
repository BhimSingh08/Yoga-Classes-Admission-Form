- Hello, I have created this beautiful project using the MERN stack as an internship assignment of Flexmoney.

- My approach for this project was:-

1. Create frontend of the admission form using html, css and reactjs.
2. Make the form responsive so that it does not get distorted in any device.
3. Create the backend of the form using nodejs, expressjs and mongoDB.
4. Do the basic validations as stated in the assignment.
5. Show a "Payment Successful" message when the user is registered.

- The basic validations which I did in the project are as follows:-

1. Every input field should be filled by the user.
2. User name must not be empty.
3. Age field must be between 18 and 65 years.
4. Gender should must be specified by the user.
5. Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
6. Fees should be exactly equal to 500.
7. User must select a slot in order to make the payment.
